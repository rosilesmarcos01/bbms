
# authID integration as a React.js Component

This [authID](https://authid.ai/) React.js Component provides a convenient integration overlay. The overlay hovers over your website in desktop environment and occupies maximum space in mobile environment.

This integration uses [@authid/web-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@authid/web-component) package.

## Integration

The plugin is not preprocessed with Babel intentionally. Please make sure your Webpack or other build tool configuration handles translation of `node_modules/@authid/*.js` modules.

React.js with hooks is a peer dependency.

## API

* `AuthIDComponent` - a React.js component with the following properties:
    - `url` - required parameter with operation/transaction URL received from authID,
    - `target` - force selection of either `mobile` or `desktop` integration variant, `auto` is the default,
    - `webauth=true` - enable automatic handling of WebAuth features,
    - `control=(msg, authidControlFace) => {}` - enable advanced control features with a special callback.

## Example

Please see `example.jsx` and `example.html` for full details.

*Note: you will need to install development dependencies and build example.min.js first.*

```jsx
import AuthIDComponent from '@authid/react-component';

const App = () => {
    return <AuthIDComponent url="https://id.authid.ai/?...." />;
};
```
