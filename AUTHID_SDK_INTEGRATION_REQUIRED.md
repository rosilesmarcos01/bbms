# AuthID SDK Integration Required

## Current Status
✅ Backend AuthID API integration is complete and working
✅ Authentication with AuthID successful (using API keys)
✅ Account creation working
✅ Operation creation working (returns OperationId and OneTimeSecret)
❌ **iOS AuthID SDK not integrated** - Cannot complete enrollment flow

## The Problem
The AuthID enrollment process requires the **AuthID iOS SDK** to capture biometric data directly on the device. Web URLs won't work because:
1. AuthID doesn't provide a web-based enrollment page
2. Biometric capture must happen natively using the SDK
3. The `OperationId` and `OneTimeSecret` are passed to the SDK, not to a URL

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Integrate AuthID iOS SDK (Recommended)
Contact AuthID to get access to their iOS SDK and integrate it into the BBMS app.

**Steps:**
1. Contact AuthID support to get SDK access
2. Add the AuthID SDK to your Xcode project via SPM/CocoaPods
3. Update `BiometricAuthService.swift` to use the AuthID SDK
4. Pass `OperationId` and `OneTimeSecret` to the SDK's enrollment method

**Example Integration:**
```swift
import AuthIDSDK // After adding the SDK

class BiometricAuthService: ObservableObject {
    private let authIDSDK = AuthIDSDK.shared
    
    func startBiometricEnrollment(userId: String) async throws -> EnrollmentResult {
        // Get operation from backend
        let response = try await initiateEnrollment(userId: userId)
        
        // Use AuthID SDK to perform enrollment
        let result = try await authIDSDK.enroll(
            operationId: response.operationId,
            secret: response.oneTimeSecret,
            baseURL: "https://id-uat.authid.ai"
        )
        
        return EnrollmentResult(success: result.isSuccess)
    }
}
```

### Option 2: Use Alternative Biometric Solution
If you can't get the AuthID SDK, consider:
- **FaceID/TouchID** - Use Apple's native biometric authentication
- **Other SDKs** - Onfido, Jumio, or Veriff for identity verification
- **Password-only** - Temporarily disable biometric features

### Option 3: Mock Enrollment for Development (Temporary)
For testing purposes only, you can mock the enrollment:

```swift
func mockBiometricEnrollment() async throws {
    // Simulate successful enrollment
    await MainActor.run {
        self.isEnrolled = true
        self.enrollmentMessage = "Mock enrollment successful"
    }
}
```

## Current Backend Response
The backend now correctly returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "enrollmentId": "operation-id-here",
  "operationId": "f9f96247-0ad6-d1db-0c68-54ab22d05d9b",
  "oneTimeSecret": "WjpETH3AyxNdrhIMpJefFJhe",
  "enrollmentUrl": "https://id-uat.authid.ai/IDCompleteBackendEngine/IdentityService/v1/enroll?...",
  "deepLink": "authid://enroll?operationId=...&secret=...",
  "qrCode": "{\"operationId\":\"...\",\"secret\":\"...\",\"type\":\"enrollment\"}",
  "expiresAt": "2025-10-08T17:46:54.465Z"
}
```

## What You Need from AuthID
1. **iOS SDK** - Swift package or CocoaPods dependency
2. **SDK Documentation** - Integration guide for iOS
3. **Sample Code** - Example enrollment and verification flows
4. **Support** - Technical contact for integration questions

## Next Steps
1. **Contact AuthID** - Request SDK access and documentation
2. **Decide on approach** - SDK integration vs alternative solution
3. **Update iOS app** - Integrate chosen solution
4. **Test flow** - Verify end-to-end enrollment and authentication

## Contact Information
- **AuthID Support**: Check your AuthID account dashboard for support contacts
- **Documentation**: Usually provided with SDK access
- **Sales/Technical**: Your AuthID account representative

---

**Note**: The backend is fully functional. Once you have the AuthID iOS SDK, the integration should be straightforward - you just need to pass the `operationId` and `oneTimeSecret` to their SDK's enrollment method.
