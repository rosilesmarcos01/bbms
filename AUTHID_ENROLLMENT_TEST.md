# AuthID Enrollment - Ready to Test! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Correct Package Installed**
   - Changed from `@authid/react-component` ❌ to `@authid/web-component` ✅
   - Package successfully installed via npm

### 2. **Proper React Build Setup**
   - Created React components: `AuthIDEnrollment.js`
   - Set up webpack build system
   - Successfully built production bundle (152 KB)
   - Bundle served at: `http://192.168.100.9:3002/dist/bundle.js`

### 3. **AuthID Component Integration**
   - Using `AuthIDComponent` from `@authid/web-component`
   - Proper props configured:
     - `url`: Full operation URL with secret
     - `target`: "auto" (adapts to device)
     - `webauth`: true (enables WebAuth features)
     - `control`: Callback for handling success/error/cancel

### 4. **Services Running**
   - ✅ Auth service: `http://192.168.100.9:3001`
   - ✅ AuthID web service: `http://192.168.100.9:3002`
   - ✅ Backend service: `http://192.168.100.9:3000`

## 🧪 How to Test Enrollment

### Step 1: Open BBMS App on iPhone
   - Launch the BBMS app
   - Make sure your iPhone is on the same WiFi network (192.168.100.x)

### Step 2: Go to Login Screen
   - If already logged in, log out first
   - You should see the login screen with biometric setup option

### Step 3: Start Enrollment
   - Tap the **"Enable Biometric Authentication"** button
   - Or tap **"Open Enrollment Page"** if visible
   - This should open Safari with the enrollment URL

### Step 4: Complete Enrollment
   - Safari should load the enrollment page
   - You should see the AuthID biometric capture interface
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to capture your face
   - Grant camera permissions if prompted

### Step 5: Verify Success
   - Upon successful capture, you should see: "✅ Enrollment Complete!"
   - Return to the BBMS app
   - Your biometric enrollment should now be active

## 🔍 What to Watch For

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ Browser opens without errors
- ✅ Page loads with AuthID interface (not an error message)
- ✅ Camera permission prompt appears
- ✅ Face capture UI is visible
- ✅ Success message after capture
- ✅ Can close browser and return to app

### Possible Issues:
- ❌ "Component Load Error" - Component didn't load (shouldn't happen now)
- ❌ "Missing Parameters" - URL construction problem
- ❌ Camera permission denied - Need to grant camera access
- ❌ "Enrollment Failed" - AuthID API error (check operation ID/secret)

## 📱 Enrollment URL Format

The app generates URLs like this:
```
http://192.168.100.9:3002/?operationId=xxx&secret=yyy&baseUrl=https://id-uat.authid.ai
```

The React app then constructs the full AuthID operation URL:
```
https://id-uat.authid.ai/IDCompleteBackendEngine/Default/AuthorizationServiceRest/v2/operations/{operationId}?secret={secret}
```

---

## 🎮 Control Flow

1. **iOS App** → Calls `/auth/biometric/enroll` endpoint
2. **Auth Service** → Creates AuthID account + operation
3. **Auth Service** → Returns operation ID, secret, and enrollment URL
4. **iOS App** → Opens enrollment URL in Safari
5. **Safari** → Loads React app from authid-web service
6. **React App** → Renders `AuthIDComponent` with operation URL
7. **AuthID Component** → Handles biometric capture
8. **On Success** → Shows completion message
9. **User** → Returns to iOS app

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Server Logs:
```bash
# In the terminal running authid-web
# Look for console.log messages about:
# - Operation ID received
# - Secret received  
# - AuthID component loading
# - Control messages (success/error/cancel)
```

### Check iOS Console:
- Look for enrollment URL being generated
- Check for any network errors
- Verify Safari opens with correct URL

### Check Network:
```bash
# Verify services are accessible
curl http://192.168.100.9:3001/health
curl http://192.168.100.9:3002
curl -I http://192.168.100.9:3002/dist/bundle.js
```

## 📝 Next Steps After Testing

### If Enrollment Works:
1. Test biometric login/verification
2. Document the full flow
3. Add error handling improvements
4. Test on different devices

### If Issues Occur:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all services are running
3. Confirm IP address is correct (192.168.100.9)
4. Test with `update-ip.sh` if network changed
5. Check AuthID API credentials in `.env`
