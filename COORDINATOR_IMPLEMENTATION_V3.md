# 🔧 SafariView Coordinator Implementation - v3

## What Changed

The previous approaches didn't work because:
1. `.onAppear`/`.onDisappear` modifiers don't fire on `UIViewControllerRepresentable`
2. Simple callback in `makeUIViewController` might run too early

## New Solution: Coordinator Pattern

Added a **Coordinator** class that properly manages the Safari view lifecycle:

```swift
struct SafariView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    let url: URL
    var onAppear: (() -> Void)?
    var onDisappear: (() -> Void)?
    
    func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
        Coordinator(onAppear: onAppear, onDisappear: onDisappear)
    }
    
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> SFSafariViewController {
        let safari = SFSafariViewController(url: url)
        context.coordinator.safari = safari
        
        print("🔧 SafariView makeUIViewController called")
        
        // Trigger onAppear after a short delay
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
            print("🔄 Safari sheet appeared - starting enrollment status polling...")
            context.coordinator.onAppear?()
        }
        
        return safari
    }
    
    static func dismantleUIViewController(_ uiViewController: SFSafariViewController, coordinator: Coordinator) {
        print("🚪 SafariView being dismantled - calling onDisappear")
        coordinator.onDisappear?()
    }
    
    class Coordinator {
        var onAppear: (() -> Void)?
        var onDisappear: (() -> Void)?
        weak var safari: SFSafariViewController?
        
        init(onAppear: (() -> Void)?, onDisappear: (() -> Void)?) {
            self.onAppear = onAppear
            self.onDisappear = onDisappear
        }
    }
}
```

## Expected Log Sequence

Now you should see THREE logs in sequence:

```
1. ✅ Valid URL created: https://192.168.100.9:3002?operationId=...
2. 🔧 SafariView makeUIViewController called                          ← NEW!
3. 🔄 Safari sheet appeared - starting enrollment status polling...   ← KEY LOG!
4. ⏱️ Polling enrollment status...
5. ⏱️ Polling enrollment status...
```

## Why This Should Work

1. **Coordinator is created first** - iOS lifecycle guarantee
2. **Debug log added** - `"🔧 SafariView makeUIViewController called"` confirms creation
3. **0.1 second delay** - Ensures Safari is fully presented before starting polling
4. **Proper dismantling** - `dismantleUIViewController` with Coordinator properly calls onDisappear

## Test Steps

### 1. Rebuild (CRITICAL!)
```bash
Cmd + R
```

### 2. Start Enrollment
- Log in as marcos@bbms.ai
- Go to Settings → Biometric Setup
- Tap "Set Up Face ID"

### 3. Watch Console - MUST SEE ALL THREE LOGS:

```
✅ Valid URL created: https://...
🔧 SafariView makeUIViewController called          ← If you see this, creation is working
🔄 Safari sheet appeared - starting enrollment...   ← If you see this, callback is working!
```

### 4. What Each Log Means

| Log | Meaning | What It Tells Us |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| `✅ Valid URL created` | URL is valid | Enrollment initiated successfully |
| `🔧 SafariView makeUIViewController called` | Safari view created | SwiftUI is creating the view controller |
| `🔄 Safari sheet appeared` | **Callback fired!** | **Polling has started!** |
| `⏱️ Polling enrollment status` | Timer working | Status checks running every 3 seconds |

## Troubleshooting

### Scenario A: No logs after "✅ Valid URL created"
**Problem**: Safari sheet not being presented at all
**Check**: 
- Is `showingEnrollmentSheet` being set to `true`?
- Add log in `startEnrollment()` function

### Scenario B: See "🔧" but NOT "🔄"
**Problem**: Coordinator created but callback not firing
**Possible cause**: `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` not executing
**Next step**: We may need to use a different timing mechanism

### Scenario C: See both "🔧" and "🔄"! ✅
**Status**: **SUCCESS!** Polling is working!
**Next**: Watch for polling logs every 3 seconds
**Expected**: Safari auto-closes when enrollment completes

## Success Criteria

✅ See "🔧 SafariView makeUIViewController called"
✅ See "🔄 Safari sheet appeared - starting enrollment status polling..."
✅ See "⏱️ Polling enrollment status..." every 3 seconds
✅ Safari closes automatically after enrollment
✅ Success alert appears
✅ Biometric button appears on login screen after logout

## If Still No Logs

If you still don't see the "🔧" log, it means:
- Safari view is not being created at all
- The sheet presentation is failing silently
- We need to debug the sheet presentation itself

Please report back with:
1. Do you see "🔧 SafariView makeUIViewController called"?
2. Do you see "🔄 Safari sheet appeared"?
3. Does Safari actually open on screen?
4. Full console output from tapping "Set Up Face ID"
