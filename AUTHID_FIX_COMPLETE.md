4. ❌ Linting errors in code

### Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Added `initiateBiometricEnrollment()` method
2. ✅ Added `verifyBiometric()` method
3. ✅ Added `checkEnrollmentProgress()` method
4. ✅ Changed export to singleton pattern
5. ✅ Added `getUserByBiometricTemplate()` to UserService
6. ✅ Updated biometric login flow to identify users first
7. ✅ Fixed all linting errors

## 🚀 Current Capabilities

### ✅ Working Features:

#### 1. User Registration
```bash
POST /api/auth/register
# Creates user + initiates biometric enrollment
```

#### 2. Biometric Enrollment
```bash
POST /api/biometric/enroll
# Returns enrollment URL and QR code
```

#### 3. Enrollment Status
```bash
GET /api/biometric/enrollment/status?enrollmentId=xxx
# Checks enrollment progress
```

#### 4. Biometric Login
```bash
POST /api/auth/biometric-login
# Authenticates via biometric data
```

#### 5. Traditional Login
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
# Standard email/password authentication
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Service Status:
```
✅ AuthID Service initialized with UAT environment
✅ Initialized 3 sample users (marcos@bbms.ai, oscar@bbms.ai, clay@bbms.ai)
✅ All routes mounted successfully
✅ Service running on port 3001
```

### Test Users:
| Email | Password | Role | Access Level |
|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| marcos@bbms.ai | admin123 | admin | admin |
| oscar@bbms.ai | admin123 | manager | elevated |
| clay@bbms.ai | admin123 | technician | standard |

### Quick Test Commands:

#### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/biometric/test
```

#### Test 2: Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"marcos@bbms.ai","password":"admin123"}'
```

#### Test 3: Biometric Login (Mock)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/biometric-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "verificationData": {
      "biometric_template": "test-template",
      "verification_method": "face",
      "device_info": {"device_id":"ios-sim","platform":"iOS"}
    }
  }'
```

## 📊 Development Mode Behavior

### Current Implementation:
- **Mock Enrollment**: Generates fake enrollment URLs/QR codes
- **Mock Verification**: Always succeeds with 95.5% confidence
- **In-Memory Storage**: Data resets on server restart
- **Perfect for Testing**: iOS app can test full flow

### Expected Responses:

#### Enrollment Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Biometric enrollment initiated",
  "enrollment": {
    "enrollmentId": "enroll_user-id_timestamp",
    "enrollmentUrl": "https://id-uat.authid.ai/enroll/...",
    "qrCode": "data:text/plain;base64,...",
    "expiresAt": "2025-10-09T15:40:23.000Z"
  }
}
```

#### Login Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Biometric login successful",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Marcos Rosiles",
    "email": "marcos@bbms.ai",
    "role": "admin",
    "accessLevel": "admin"
  },
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "biometric": {
    "confidence": 95.5,
    "verificationId": "verify_1728..."
  }
}
```
