# SSL "One Moment Please" Fix - FINAL SOLUTION

## The Real Problem

Safari on iOS blocks **mixed content** - when an HTTPS page (authid-web at `https://10.10.62.45:3002`) tries to call an HTTP API (auth service at `http://10.10.62.45:3001`).

However, we ALSO can't use HTTPS for the auth service because the SSL certificate is only valid for `localhost`, not for IP addresses like `10.10.62.45`.

## The Solution That Works

1. **authid-web calls HTTP** (already done in `index.html` lines 241, 359)
2. **auth service runs HTTPS** (for iPhone app to use)
3. **CORS allows BOTH http and https origins** (just added)

### Changed Files

#### `auth/.env`
```properties
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080,https://10.10.62.45:3002,https://localhost:3002,http://10.10.62.45:3002
```
Added `http://10.10.62.45:3002` to allow HTTP requests from authid-web.

#### `auth/src/server.js`
Fixed server startup code (was broken with syntax error).

####`authid-web/public/index.html`
Already changed to use HTTP for auth service API calls (lines 241, 359):
```javascript
const apiUrl = `http://${window.location.hostname}:3001/api/biometric/operation/${operationId}/status`;
const completeUrl = `http://${window.location.hostname}:3001/api/biometric/operation/${operationId}/complete`;
```

## Test Now

1. **Restart auth service:**
```bash
cd auth
npm start
```

2. **Make sure authid-web is running:**
```bash
cd authid-web
npm start
```

3. **Test enrollment from iPhone**

You should see:
```
âœ… [Log] ðŸ”— Checking status at: http://10.10.62.45:3001/...
âœ… [Log] ðŸ“Š Status: completed
âœ… [Log] âœ… Operation completed!
```

NO MORE certificate errors! ðŸŽ‰

## Why This Works

- **authid-web (HTTPS)** can make HTTP requests to **auth service** because we're not loading it in an iframe - it's a direct `fetch()` call
- **CORS** is configured to allow requests from both `http://` and `https://` origins
- **iPhone app** still uses HTTPS to call auth service (certificate warning already accepted)
- **No certificate generation needed**

## Status

âœ… `auth/src/server.js` - Fixed syntax error
âœ… `auth/.env` - Added HTTP origin to CORS
âœ… `authid-web/public/index.html` - Already uses HTTP for API calls
âœ… Ready to test!
