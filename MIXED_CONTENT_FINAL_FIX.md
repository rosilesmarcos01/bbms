# Mixed Content Security Fix - FINAL

## Problem Identified
Safari was blocking HTTP requests from HTTPS pages due to **Mixed Content Security Policy**:

```
[Warning] [blocked] The page at https://10.10.62.45:3002 requested insecure content 
from http://10.10.62.45:3001. This content was blocked and must be served over HTTPS.
```

### Why It Failed
1. **authid-web** runs on HTTPS (port 3002)
2. We tried to make **HTTP** calls to auth service (port 3001)
3. Safari blocks mixed content (HTTPS â†’ HTTP) for security
4. Both status polling AND completion endpoint were blocked

## Solution: Use Same Protocol

Changed `authid-web/public/index.html` to use `window.location.protocol` instead of hardcoded `http://`:

### Status Check Endpoint (Line ~240)
**Before:**
```javascript
const apiUrl = `http://${window.location.hostname}:3001/api/biometric/operation/${operationId}/status`;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const apiUrl = `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.hostname}:3001/api/biometric/operation/${operationId}/status`;
```

### Complete Endpoint (Line ~357)
**Before:**
```javascript
const completeUrl = `http://${window.location.hostname}:3001/api/biometric/operation/${operationId}/complete`;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const completeUrl = `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.hostname}:3001/api/biometric/operation/${operationId}/complete`;
```

## How It Works Now

1. **authid-web** loads via HTTPS: `https://10.10.62.45:3002`
2. JavaScript reads `window.location.protocol` â†’ `"https:"`
3. API calls are made to: `https://10.10.62.45:3001/api/...`
4. **No mixed content blocking** because both use HTTPS
5. Browser shows SSL warning initially (self-signed cert) but user accepts it
6. After acceptance, all HTTPS requests work smoothly

## SSL Certificate Note

The self-signed certificates are only valid for `localhost`, not IP addresses like `10.10.62.45`. 

**This causes:**
- Initial SSL warning when accessing `https://10.10.62.45:3002`
- Initial SSL warning when accessing `https://10.10.62.45:3001` 

**User action required:**
- Accept the SSL warning in Safari
- iOS Safari: May need to trust certificate in Settings â†’ General â†’ About â†’ Certificate Trust Settings

**But:** Once accepted, enrollment works perfectly!

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart authid-web server:**
   ```bash
   cd authid-web
   node server.js
   ```

2. **From iOS app, start enrollment**
   - App generates enrollment URL with HTTPS
   - Safari opens `https://10.10.62.45:3002/...`

3. **Accept SSL warning** (one time)
   - Safari shows "This connection is not private"
   - Tap "Show Details" â†’ "Visit this website"

4. **Complete selfie**
   - AuthID component loads successfully
   - Take selfie
   - Verification completes
   - **Status polling now works** (HTTPS â†’ HTTPS)
   - **Complete endpoint now works** (HTTPS â†’ HTTPS)
   - Page auto-closes
   - iOS app receives success

## Why This Is The Right Fix

1. âœ… **Respects browser security** - No mixed content
2. âœ… **Works with dynamic IPs** - Uses `window.location` automatically
3. âœ… **Maintains HTTPS encryption** - All traffic encrypted
4. âœ… **Works on iOS Safari** - Strict security policy satisfied
5. âœ… **No server changes needed** - Both services already support HTTPS
6. âœ… **CORS already configured** - ALLOWED_ORIGINS includes HTTPS origins

## Files Modified
- âœ… `authid-web/public/index.html` - Changed lines ~240 and ~357

## Status
ðŸŽ¯ **READY TO TEST** - This should resolve the enrollment freeze!

The previous HTTP approach was correct in theory but blocked by Safari's mixed content policy. Using HTTPS throughout is the proper solution.
