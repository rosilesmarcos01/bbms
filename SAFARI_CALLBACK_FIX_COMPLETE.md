# ✅ Safari Callback Implementation - FIXED

## Final Solution

The issue was that `.onAppear` and `.onDisappear` modifiers don't work reliably on `UIViewControllerRepresentable` views in SwiftUI. 

### What We Changed

#### 1. Updated `SafariView` struct to accept callbacks:

```swift
struct SafariView: UIViewControllerRepresentable {
    let url: URL
    var onAppear: (() -> Void)?
    var onDisappear: (() -> Void)?
    
    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -> SFSafariViewController {
        let safari = SFSafariViewController(url: url)
        
        // Call onAppear when the view controller is created
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.onAppear?()
        }
        
        return safari
    }
    
    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: SFSafariViewController, context: Context) {}
    
    static func dismantleUIViewController(_ uiViewController: SFSafariViewController, coordinator: ()) {
        print("🚪 SafariView being dismantled")
    }
}
```

#### 2. Updated SafariView usage to pass callbacks:

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingEnrollmentSheet) {
    if let url = enrollmentURL {
        SafariView(
            url: url,
            onAppear: {
                print("🔄 Safari sheet appeared - starting enrollment status polling...")
                startStatusPolling()
            },
            onDisappear: {
                print("🚪 Safari sheet dismissed - stopping polling and refreshing enrollment status")
                stopStatusPolling()
                refreshEnrollmentStatus()
            }
        )
    }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **When `SafariView` is created**: `makeUIViewController` is called
2. **Immediately after creation**: `onAppear?()` callback is executed
3. **Polling starts**: Timer polls every 3 seconds
4. **When enrollment completes**: 
   - `biometricService.isEnrolled` becomes `true`
   - Timer detects this and dismisses Safari
   - Success alert shows
5. **When Safari is dismissed**: `onDisappear?()` callback is executed (if needed)

## Test Now

### Expected Log Sequence

```
1. ✅ Valid URL created: https://192.168.100.9:3002?operationId=...
2. 🔄 Safari sheet appeared - starting enrollment status polling...  ← KEY LOG!
3. ⏱️ Polling enrollment status...
4. ⏱️ Polling enrollment status...
5. [Complete enrollment in Safari]
6. 📊 HTTP Status Code: 200
7. ✅ Saved biometric_enrolled = true to keychain
8. 🎉 Enrollment detected as complete! Closing Safari sheet...
9. ✅ Status polling stopped
10. 🚪 Safari sheet dismissed - stopping polling and refreshing enrollment status
11. [Success alert appears]
```

### Critical Success Indicator

**YOU MUST SEE THIS** immediately after "✅ Valid URL created":
```
🔄 Safari sheet appeared - starting enrollment status polling...
```

If you see this log, the solution is working correctly!

## Rebuild and Test

1. **Press `Cmd + R`** in Xcode
2. **Log in** and go to Settings → Biometric Setup
3. **Tap "Set Up Face ID"**
4. **Watch console** for the "🔄 Safari sheet appeared..." log
5. **Complete enrollment** in Safari
6. **Safari should close automatically** and show success alert!

## Files Changed

- `BBMS/Views/BiometricEnrollmentView.swift`:
  - Fixed `@StateObject` declaration corruption
  - Updated `SafariView` struct with callbacks
  - Updated SafariView usage to pass `onAppear` and `onDisappear` callbacks

## Status

✅ **File corruption fixed**
✅ **Compilation errors resolved**
✅ **SafariView callbacks implemented**
✅ **Ready to test**

The solution is now complete and the code should compile without errors!
