# ðŸ”” Temperature Notification Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

Your temperature notifications weren't working when the app was in the background or when your phone was locked due to several missing configurations and implementation issues.

## What I've Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Background App Capabilities**
- Added `background-app-refresh` and `background-processing` to UIBackgroundModes

- Configured in both Debug and Release build configurations

### 2. âœ… **Enhanced Notification Permissions**
- Added `.critical` permission request for critical temperature alerts
- Improved permission checking with real-time status verification
- Added comprehensive permission status debugging

### 3. âœ… **Improved Notification Reliability**
- Enhanced notification content with categories and interaction levels
- Added unique identifiers for each notification
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added notification categories with user actions

### 4. âœ… **Better Background Monitoring**
- Fixed background task scheduling and execution
- Improved temperature monitoring service integration
- Enhanced debugging and status reporting

### 5. âœ… **Enhanced UI for Debugging**
- Updated `TemperatureMonitoringStatusView` with debug information
- Added background app refresh status display
- Added detailed notification status reporting

## How to Test the Fixes

### Phase 1: Basic Setup Testing

1. **Clean Build the App**
   ```bash
   # In Xcode, clean build folder
   Product â†’ Clean Build Folder
   # Then rebuild
   Product â†’ Build
   ```

2. **Check Notification Permissions**
   - Launch the app
   - When prompted, tap "Allow" for notifications
   - Go to Settings â†’ BBMS â†’ Notifications
   - Ensure all notification types are enabled

3. **Enable Background App Refresh**
   - Go to Settings â†’ General â†’ Background App Refresh
   - Ensure "Background App Refresh" is ON
   - Find your BBMS app and ensure it's enabled

### Phase 2: Foreground Testing

1. **Test While App is Active**
   - Open the app
   - Navigate to a device detail view
   - Set a low temperature limit (e.g., 20Â°C)
   - Wait for the monitoring to detect the temperature breach
   - You should see notifications appear even while the app is open

### Phase 3: Background Testing

1. **Test Background Notifications**
   - Set temperature limits on your devices
   - Put the app in background (press home button)
   - Wait 15-30 minutes for background tasks to execute
   - Check if notifications appear on lock screen

2. **Test Lock Screen Notifications**
   - Lock your phone
   - Wait for temperature monitoring cycles
   - Notifications should appear on lock screen when limits are exceeded

### Phase 4: Debug Information

1. **Use the Enhanced Debug View**
   - Open the app
   - Navigate to the Dashboard
   - Look for the Temperature Monitoring status card
   - Tap "Show Debug Info" to see detailed status
   - Check all statuses are green/enabled

2. **Check Console Logs**
   - In Xcode, view the console output
   - Look for these log messages:
     - `âœ… Notification permissions granted`
     - `âœ… Temperature alert notification scheduled`
     - `ðŸš¨ Critical temperature alert notification scheduled`
     - `Background check: Temperature alert triggered`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Notifications Not Appearing
**Solution:**
1. Check notification permissions in device Settings
2. Verify Background App Refresh is enabled
3. Restart the app to reinitialize services

### Issue 2: Background Monitoring Not Working
**Solution:**
1. Ensure the app has been in background for at least 15 minutes
2. Check that Background App Refresh is enabled system-wide
3. Verify the app isn't being killed by iOS due to excessive resource usage

### Issue 3: Critical Alerts Not Working
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you granted critical alert permissions
2. Check that Do Not Disturb settings allow critical alerts
3. Verify the temperature exceeds the critical threshold (10Â°C above normal limit)

## Technical Details

### Background Task Scheduling
- Background tasks are scheduled every 15 minutes
- Tasks have limited execution time (usually 30 seconds)
- iOS may delay or deny background execution based on usage patterns

### Temperature Monitoring Logic
- Normal alerts: When temperature > set limit
- Critical alerts: When temperature > (set limit + 10Â°C)
- Cooldown period: 5 minutes between alerts for the same device

### Notification Categories
- `TEMPERATURE_ALERT`: Regular temperature breach notifications
- `CRITICAL_TEMPERATURE_ALERT`: Critical temperature notifications with higher priority

## Testing Tips

1. **Use Low Temperature Limits**: Set limits like 20Â°C to easily trigger alerts during testing
2. **Monitor Console Logs**: Keep Xcode console open to see real-time monitoring activity
3. **Test Multiple Scenarios**: Test foreground, background, and lock screen scenarios
4. **Be Patient**: Background tasks may take time to execute depending on iOS scheduling

## If Issues Persist

1. **Reset Notification Permissions**:
   - Delete and reinstall the app
   - Grant permissions when prompted

2. **Check iOS Restrictions**:
   - iOS 12+ has stricter background execution policies
   - Users must interact with the app regularly for background tasks to continue

3. **Verify Device Settings**:
   - Low Power Mode disables background app refresh
   - Focus modes may affect notification delivery

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] App builds without errors
- [ ] Notification permission prompt appears on first launch
- [ ] Background App Refresh is enabled for the app
- [ ] Temperature monitoring status shows "Active"
- [ ] Notification status shows "Enabled" 
- [ ] Debug info shows all permissions as granted
- [ ] Test notifications appear in foreground
- [ ] Test notifications appear when app is backgrounded
- [ ] Test notifications appear on lock screen

## Next Steps

After testing, monitor the app's behavior over several days to ensure notifications work consistently. iOS learns from usage patterns and may provide better background execution time for frequently used apps.
